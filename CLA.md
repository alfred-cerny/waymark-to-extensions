# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

By submitting a Contribution to the Project (as defined below), you ("Contributor") agree to the terms of this CLA.

## Definitions

* **"Contributor"**
  The natural person or legal entity that owns or controls the copyright in a Contribution.

* **"Contribution"**
  Any original work of authorship (code, documentation, translation, etc.) intentionally submitted by Contributor for
  inclusion in the Project.

* **"Project"**
  The Waymark Extension for EspoCRM software project licensed under GNU AGPLv3 (or any later version) maintained by the Licensor.

* **"Licensor"**
  Alfréd Černý, the copyright holder of the Waymark Extension for EspoCRM.

## Grant of Rights

### (a) Copyright

Contributor grants Licensor and its sublicensees a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to:

* reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit
  the Contribution; and

* sublicense and distribute the Contribution and its derivatives under any license terms Licensor chooses (including
  proprietary or closed-source).

### (b) Patent

Contributor grants Licensor and its sublicensees a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent
license to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution and any
derivative works.

If Contributor initiates patent litigation against Licensor or any downstream licensee over patents necessarily
infringed by the Contribution, then this patent license to that entity terminates automatically.

## Moral Rights Waiver

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Contributor irrevocably waives all "moral rights" (right of attribution,
integrity, etc.) in the Contribution, and agrees not to assert any such rights against Licensor or its licensees.

## Contributor Representations

Contributor represents and warrants that:

* The Contribution is Contributor's original work or Contributor has secured all necessary rights.

* No part of the Contribution infringes or misappropriates any third-party intellectual property rights.

* If Contributor is under any obligation (e.g. an employment agreement) that affects Contributor's ability to grant
  these rights, Contributor has obtained any necessary permissions.

## Disclaimer & Indemnity

* The Contribution is provided "AS IS," without any warranty.

* Contributor will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensor and its licensees against any claim arising from
  Contributor's breach of Section 4 or from third-party claims that the Contribution infringes intellectual property
  rights.

## Relationship to AGPLv3

* All Contributions remain licensed to end users under GNU AGPLv3 (or any later version) as published by the Free
  Software Foundation.

* This CLA grants Licensor the exclusive right to incorporate Contributions into proprietary versions and to offer
  commercial licenses without AGPL obligations. Only Licensor may exercise these dual-licensing rights.

* This CLA does not reduce or alter the rights that end users receive under the AGPL. It simply grants additional rights
  to Licensor for dual-licensing or proprietary releases.

## Acceptance; Amendments

* By submitting a pull request, commit, or any other Contribution to this repository, Contributor acknowledges they have
  read, understood, and agree to be bound by this CLA.

* Submission of a Contribution constitutes full acceptance of this CLA.

* Licensor may amend this CLA at any time by posting a new version in the Project repository or CONTRIBUTING.md.
  Continued contributions 30 days after such posting constitute acceptance of the amended terms.

## General

* **Governing law:** The laws of Czech Republic, without regard to conflict of law principles.

* **Assignment:** Contributor may not assign this CLA without Licensor's consent; Licensor may assign in connection with
  a merger or sale.

* **Entire agreement; severability:** This CLA is the entire agreement between the parties regarding Contributions. If any
  provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this CLA shall continue in full force and effect.
